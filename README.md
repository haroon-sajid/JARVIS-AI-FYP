## Overview

The **Advanced Voice Assistant** is an AI-powered project inspired by JARVIS from the Marvel Universe. This voice assistant is designed to simplify daily tasks through speech recognition, enabling users to interact with their computer using voice commands. Developed in Python, it use various libraries and APIs to perform a wide range of functions, such as code generation, image creation, web browsing, and more.

## Features

The Voice Assistant comes with a rich set of features, including:

1. **Code Generation**: Generates Python code snippets based on voice commands.
2. **Image Generation**: Creates images from text descriptions using AI models.
3. **PDF Reader**: Reads and extracts text from PDF documents.
4. **Music Player**: Plays music based on voice instructions.
5. **News Updates**: Provides the latest news headlines and summaries.
6. **Wallpaper Changer**: Changes desktop wallpapers on command.
7. **Weather Forecast**: Delivers real-time weather updates and forecasts.
8. **Wikipedia Search**: Fetches information from Wikipedia.
9. **Software Launcher**: Opens applications like Command Prompt, Chrome, Notepad, etc.
10. **Website Navigation**: Opens websites like Google, YouTube, and more in a web browser.
11. **Basic Conversation**: Engages in simple conversations with the user.
12. **Additional Functions**: Includes various other tasks to enhance productivity.

## Installation

To set up the Advanced Voice Assistant on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Advanced_JARVIS_AI_FYP.git
   cd Advanced_JARVIS_AI_FYP
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works

The Voice Assistant uses Python's Speech Recognition API to convert spoken words into text. It then processes these commands using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform the requested tasks. Key Python libraries and APIs used include:

- **SpeechRecognition**: For converting speech to text.
- **Hugging Face**: For advanced code and image generation.
- **Pyttsx3**: For converting text to speech.
- **PyPDF2**: For reading PDF files.
- **Pygame**: For playing music.
- **Requests**: For fetching weather updates and news.
- **Wikipedia**: For performing Wikipedia searches.

## Project Structure

- `MAIN.py`: The main entry point of the Voice Assistant.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the dependencies required to run the project.
- `modules/`: Contains various modules for specific tasks like weather, Wikipedia search, etc.
- `resources/`: Includes additional files like images, PDFs, and more.

## Future Enhancements

While this Voice Assistant is already feature-rich, future improvements may include:

- Enhanced NLP capabilities for more complex conversations.
- Integration with IoT devices for smart home automation.
- Support for additional languages.
- Improved accuracy and speed of command processing.
